                <p>
                    ANRPC was founded in September 1999, in line with the policy of the Egyptian Petroleum Ministry to
                    produce free-additive, high-octane gasoline and protect the environment.
                    The company aims to cover the growing local market demand while exporting the surplus.
                    Our strategy focuses on achieving horizontal integration between refineries, petroleum, and
                    petrochemical industries to increase added value.
